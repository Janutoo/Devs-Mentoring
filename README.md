## About Me

Hi! My name is Kamil, and I'm a beginner programmer enthusiastically learning the Python language. My learning is also progressing thanks to valuable mentoring, where I gain knowledge and practical skills under the guidance of experienced specialists. This repository is my digital notebook and a collection of practical examples that I create during my learning process. Here, I document various concepts, from the basic elements of the language to more advanced techniques and paradigms.

## How to Use This Repository

This repository is organized in a way that reflects my learning process. I started with the basic concepts, which can be found in the `Python Basics` folder, and then gradually moved on to more advanced topics in `Python Advance`. Additionally, in the `Docker-VirtualEnv` folder, I collect materials related to containerization and virtual environment management.

You can browse individual folders and files to see code examples (`.py`), notes, and other materials I've gathered on a given topic.

## Folder Structure

The repository is divided into three main sections:

### Docker-VirtualEnv-Flask

This folder contains materials related to Docker,Flask and virtual environments.

### Python Basics

This folder contains the fundamentals of the Python language.

### Python Advance

This folder contains more advanced concepts and libraries.

## Docker-VirtualEnv-Flask - Detailed Content Description

Here you will find materials related to:
* **Flask** Topics include basic routing, templates, form handling, and database integration.
* **Docker:** Introduction to Docker, Dockerfile, images, containers, Docker Compose.
* **Virtual Environments:** You might combine materials related to `venv` and `poetry` here, which were previously in `Python Basics`.

Please add more details about the contents of this folder when you have the opportunity.

## Python Basics - Detailed Content Description

### `Variables-Input/`

This folder contains materials on the basic elements of the Python language, such as variables and getting input from the user.

### `Conditions-If-Else/`

Here you will find examples and notes on conditional statements.

### `Loops-While-For/`

This folder contains materials about loops.

### `Functions-Definitions/`

Here I am learning about defining and using functions.

### `Data-Structures/`

This folder is dedicated to basic data structures in Python.

### `File-Operations/`

Here you will find materials related to working with files.

### `JSON/`

This folder contains information about working with the JSON format.

### `OOP-Classes-Inheritance/`

This folder contains materials on object-oriented programming, and in particular:

* **`Classes/`**: Basics of defining and using classes.
* **`Inheritance/`**: Concepts of inheritance.

## Python Advance - Detailed Content Description

### `Architecture-Patterns/`

Materials on architectural patterns (e.g., MVC, MVT).

### `Async-Await/`

Materials on asynchronous programming in Python.

### `Clean-Code-SOLID/`

Clean code principles and SOLID principles in object-oriented programming.

### `Comprehensions-Generators/`

Examples and explanations of list comprehensions, generators, and generator expressions.

### `Concurrency-Parallelism/`

Introduction to concurrency and parallelism (multithreading, multiprocessing).

### `Decorators/`

Notes and examples of using decorators to modify functions.

### `Design-Patterns/`

Introduction to popular design patterns (e.g., Adapter, Strategy, Observer, Factory).

### `Exceptions-Error-Handling/`

Materials on error handling and exceptions (`try`, `except`, `finally`).

### `Functional-Programming/`

Introduction to the functional programming paradigm in Python.

### `Regular-Expressions-RegEx/`

Materials on using regular expressions to match patterns in text (the `re` module).

## My Learning Goals

My goal is to gain a solid understanding of the Python language, from the basics to advanced programming techniques. I want to learn how to write clean, efficient, and well-organized code.

## Useful Resources

Here are some resources that I find helpful in my learning:

* Official Python Documentation: [https://docs.python.org/3/](https://docs.python.org/3/)
* Devs-Mentoring
* Stack Overflow ([https://stackoverflow.com/](https://stackoverflow.com/)) - invaluable help for solving problems.

## How You Can Help (if publicly shared)

If you are a more experienced programmer and come across any errors in my code examples or have suggestions for improvements, I would be grateful for any feedback. I am eager to learn from others and appreciate any form of support.
